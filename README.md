Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

My project is an interest tracker where users can input a deposit, the time of placing the deposit, and the interest rate. It will calculate the total accrued amount using the simple interest formula. This web app is a complete fullstack app with a database that will display only information specific to the user that is logged in. The challenges I faced were numerous. One of the biggest ones was trying to configure passport.js to work as my authentication method because it took a lot to understand the underlying process of how it works and how I can apply it to my own express server. The authentication strategy I used was the Github OAuth using passport.js. I used this strategy since I wanted to challenge myself with the technical achievement and it helped me understand the online aspect of it and not just local authentication. The CSS framework I used was pico.css and I used it because it looked crisp and clean and fit the aesthetic of my interest tracker, which aimed to be very straightforward, organized, and not too colorful. I modifed some of the colors of the button in the custom.css file so that it can pass the accessibility lighthouse test. I also added some divs with ids to shift the positions of my elements around. The five Express middleware packages I used are handlebars, passport, cookie-session, method-override, and a custom middleware that keeps unauthenticated users in the login page. Handlebars was used for server-side rendering that allowed me to put custom texts like username data and popup notifications depending on each client. Passport was used for GitHub OAuth. Cookie-session was used for tracking the client's cookies so that they can come back to their session if they did not log out. Method-override was used so that I can implement my own DELETE method instead of using POST to keep my code more organized. The custom middleware function that I made makes sure to redirect users who are not authenticated back to the login page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Lighthouse Tests**: I scored 100 for both login and main page on the lighthouse tests for Performance, Accessibility, Best practices, and SEO. Screenshots found below:
